Suppose you are testing a program that accepts as input the profit of a small
company and ouputs a suggested educational donation for that company according
to the following scheme:

	Negative profit (i.e. a loss): $100 donation
	Profits less than $100,000:    2% of profits, but not less than $200
	Profits of $100,000 or more:   $2,000 + 1% of excess over $100,000

Which one of the following is the best set of input data for testing this
program?

A. All of the following are equally good.
B. 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000
C. -1000, -100, 0, 1000, 100000
D. -100, 0, 100, 50000, 100000, 200000
E. -1000, 0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 10000

The Java statement:

	for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
		if ((i <= 4) && (i > 2))
			System.out.print("   " + i);
	}

will produce the output:

A. 1   2   3   4   5   6
B. 2   3   4
C. 1   2   3   4   3   4   5   6
D. 3   4
E. 3

#

Consider:

	class Prob5 {
		static void silly() {
			int temp = x; x *= y; y = temp;
		}

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			int x = 3; int y = 4;
			silly();
		}
	}

What will be the output of this program?

A. This code will not even compile!
B. 4
C. 3
D. 12
E. An error will occur at execution time!

#

The effect of the statements:

	int m = 9;
	int n = 4;
	m += n;
	n = m - n;
	m = m - n;
	System.out.print(m + "     " + n);

is to produce the output:

A.  4     9
B.  5     5
C. 13     5
D.  9     4
E. 13     9

When people bet on horse races, the racetrack always reduces its payoffs to
the largest multiple of 20 cents that does not exceed the exact payoff. This
means, for example, that if a payoff was 63 cents, the racetrack would only
pay 60 cents.

Assuming that the variable payoff is an int variable that holds a number of
cents, this reduction could be achieved by the Java statement:

A. payoff = 20 * payoff % 20;
B. payoff = 20 * payoff / 20;
C. payoff = payoff % 20 * 20;
D. payoff = payoff - (int) payoff / 20;
E. payoff = (payoff / 20) * 20;

Methods w/Args
#

What is the output of the code below?:

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int x = 2;
		int y = 5;
		mystery(x + 2, y);
	}

	public static void mystery(int y, int x) {
		System.out.println(x);
	}

#

Which of the following method calls is legal given the following method:

	public static void myMethod(int a, boolean b, double d) {

	}

A. myMethod(true, 20, 1.0);
B. myMethod(6, true || false, 3.5);
C. myMethod(1 + 1, 0.0, 1.0);
D. myMethod(1.0, false, 1.0);
E. myMethod(1, true, true);

#

In how many print statements is the variable "x" available for use (in scope?):

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int a = 10;
		System.out.println(_____); 		// 1
		myMethod(a);
		System.out.println(_____);		// 2
	}

	public static void myMethod(int x) {
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
			sum += i;
			System.out.println(_____);	// 3
		}

		System.out.println(_____);		// 4
		if (sum > 10) {
			System.out.println(_____);	// 5
		}
	}

#

Which of the following method signatures would be most appropriate for a method
which prints the name of the user followed by his birthday? For example, the
method should be given enough information to print "Barack Obama, August 4".

A. printBirthday(name, month, day);
B. printBirthday(String name, month, int day);
C. printBirthday();
D. printBirthday(String name, String month, int day);
E. printBirthday(int month, int day);

#

What is the output of the code below?:

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		int four = 4;
		int twelve = 20;
		int five = 4;

		four = ++four;
		twelve += 6;
		multiply(four, five, twelve);
	}

	public static void multiply(int apples, int oranges, int bananas) {
		System.out.println(apples + " * " + oranges + " = " + bananas);
	}

#
For Loops
#

What is the output of the following for loop?:

	for (int i = 10; i <= 21; i += 2) {
		System.out.print(i + 1);
	}

#

What is the output of the following for loop?

	for (int i = 10; i >= 0; --i) {
		System.out.println(i);
		i--;
	}

#

Fill in the blank to make the following nested for loops print out this pattern:

****
***
**
*

	for (int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {

		}
		i--;
	}

#

Getting input from the user using a Scanner object.

Fill in the blank below (and use the Scanner named input) so that if the user
enters "Cody 1" the output of the program is:

	System.out.print(_____);
